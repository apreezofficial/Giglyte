# **Giglyte: Your Next Gig Platform! ðŸš€**

Giglyte is a robust web application designed to connect clients with freelancers, making it incredibly straightforward to find and post jobs. Built on the powerful Laravel 12 framework and featuring a snappy frontend powered by Vite and Tailwind CSS, this platform offers a seamless experience for managing user accounts and job listings. Itâ€™s engineered for efficiency and scalability, providing a solid foundation for any modern gig economy application.

## **Usage**

Getting Giglyte up and running, and then interacting with its features, is quite straightforward!

### **1. Initial Setup**

First, ensure you have PHP, Composer, Node.js, and npm installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd giglyte-project-directory
    ```
2.  **Install PHP dependencies**:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Install Node.js dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Copy the environment file**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5.  **Generate application key**:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
6.  **Set up the database**:
    By default, Giglyte uses SQLite for local development. Ensure the `database/database.sqlite` file exists. If not, create it:
    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```
    Then, run migrations to create the necessary tables:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
7.  **Start the development servers**:
    This command will concurrently run the Laravel development server, queue listener, logs, and Vite for frontend compilation.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should now be able to access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or similar, as indicated by the `php artisan serve` output).

### **2. User Workflow (API & Views)**

Giglyte provides both API endpoints and simple web views for basic user interactions.

#### **Registration**
*   **Web View**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/user/register` in your browser. Fill out the email and password fields and submit the form.
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/user/create` with `email` and `password` in the request body.

#### **Email Verification**
*   **Web View**: After registration, you'll need to verify your email. Go to `http://localhost:8000/user/verify`. Enter your registered email and the verification code sent to you (this code is currently stored in the `verification_code` column of the `users` table for local testing, as email sending isn't fully configured).
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/user/verify` with `email` and `code` in the request body.

#### **Login**
*   **Web View**: Access the login form at `http://localhost:8000/user/login`. Provide your verified email and password.
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/user/login` with `email` and `password`. On successful login, the API will return a `token` which is essential for authenticated actions like creating jobs.

#### **Finalizing User Profile (Optional)**
*   **Web View**: After successful email verification, you can finalize your profile details at `http://localhost:8000/user/final`.
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/user/final` with your `email` and additional user data (`first_name`, `last_name`, `username`, `country`, `skills`, `profile_image`, `bio`, `type`). This endpoint also ensures the email is verified first.

### **3. Job Management**

#### **Creating a Job**
Creating a job requires a valid authentication token obtained from the user login.
*   **Web View**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/jobs/create`. This page includes a jQuery script that hardcodes a `Bearer` token for demonstration. **Note**: For a production-ready application, this token should be dynamically retrieved and securely managed after user login.
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/jobs/create`.
    *   **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <Your_Auth_Token>` (the token received from the `/user/login` endpoint).
    *   **Body (JSON)**:
        ```json
        {
            "title": "Your Job Title",
            "delivery_time": "3 days",
            "status": "active",
            "description": "A detailed description of the job.",
            "tags": "web-development, laravel, vuejs",
            "price": 500
        }
        ```
    The `client_id` for the job is automatically associated with the user whose token is provided.

#### **Viewing All Jobs**
*   **API Endpoint**: Send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/jobs/all` to retrieve a list of all available jobs.

## **Features**
