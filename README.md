# Giglyte: Modern Freelance Marketplace ü§ù

Giglyte is a dynamic and intuitive freelance marketplace platform designed to connect clients with talented freelancers seamlessly. This project provides a robust backend API built with Laravel, paired with a modern frontend workflow powered by Vite and Tailwind CSS. It empowers users to register, manage their profiles, post jobs, apply for opportunities, and efficiently track applications. Whether you're a client seeking expertise or a freelancer looking for your next gig, Giglyte aims to streamline the process.

## Usage

Getting Giglyte up and running is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up the development environment and explore its features.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **PHP 8.2+**: The core language for the Laravel backend.
*   **Composer**: PHP dependency manager.
*   **Node.js (LTS recommended)**: Required for Vite and frontend tooling.
*   **npm or Yarn**: JavaScript package manager.
*   **SQLite**: The default database used in this setup (no external server needed for local development).

### Setup and Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-link]
    cd giglyte # or whatever your project directory is named
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Copy the example environment file and generate an application key:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

    Ensure your `.env` file uses `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `DB_DATABASE=giglyte` (or another path to your SQLite file, e.g., `database/database.sqlite`). The `giglyte` file provided seems to be a pre-populated SQLite database, but it's good practice to ensure migrations are run.

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**

    This will set up the necessary tables for users, jobs, and applications.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

    *(Optional: If you want to seed the database with dummy data, you would run `php artisan db:seed` here, assuming seeders are implemented.)*

6.  **Link Storage (for public assets like profile images):**

    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

7.  **Start the Development Servers:**

    Open two separate terminal windows.

    **Terminal 1 (Laravel Development Server):**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    This will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

    **Terminal 2 (Vite Development Server):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```

    This compiles and serves your frontend assets with hot module reloading.

Now, your application should be accessible via `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can interact with the API or browse the Blade views directly.

### API Endpoints

Giglyte exposes a set of API endpoints for user and job management. Here are some key examples:

*   **User Registration**
    *   `POST /user/create`
    *   Payload: `{ email: "user@example.com", password: "yourpassword" }`

    *   Payload: `{ title: "Web Developer Needed", slug: "web-developer-needed", delivery_time: "2 weeks", status: "active", description: "Build a cool website.", tags: "web,php,js", price: 1500 }`
*   **Apply for a Job**
    *   `POST /apply`
    *   Payload: `{ job_id: 1, freelancer_id: 2, cover_letter: "I am perfect for this job!" }`
*   **View Job Applications for a Specific Job**
    *   `GET /job/{job_id}/applications`
*   **Update Job Application Status**
    *   `PUT /application/{id}/status`
    *   Payload: `{ status: "accepted" }` or `{ status: "rejected" }`

### Frontend Views
